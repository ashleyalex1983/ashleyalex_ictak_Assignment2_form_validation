        <p>

            town of Kannur is the headquarters of the District Kannur. Kannur District is bounded by Kasaragod 
            District to the north, Kozhikode District to the south and Wayanad District to the south-east. To 
            the east the district is bounded by the Western Ghats, which forms the border with Karnataka State, 
            in its district of Kodagu. The Arabian Sea lies to the west.Kannur District is known as the land of 
            looms and lores, because of the loom industries functioning in the district and festivals held in 
            temples. The district is a major centre of Theyyam, a ritual dance of northern Kerala.
        </p>
        <p>
            Kannur district derived its name from the location of its headquarters at Kannur town. The old name 
            'Cannanore' is the anglicised form of the Malayalam word Kannur. According to one opinion, 'Kannur' 
            is a derivation from Kanathur, an ancient village, the name of which survives even today in one of 
            the wards of Kannur Municipality. Another version is that Kannur might have assumed its name from one 
            of the , deities of the Hindu pantheon, a compound of two words, Kannan (Lord Krishna) and Ur (place) 
            making it the place of Lord Krishna. In this context, it is worth mentioning that the deity of the 
            Katalayi Sreekrishna temple was originally installed in a shrine at Katalayi Kotta in the south eastern 
            part of the present Kannur town.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is rich in natural resources and has a flourishing traditional handloom industry. It is also the 
            centre for production of cashew nut, copra, rice, tiles, electric bulb, hard board and plywood. A place 
            of historical importance, earlier a premier port. Folkdance, Kalaripayattu and Theyyam add color to 
            its broad canvas. Other towns are Thalassery, Koothuparamba, Mattannur, Payyannur, Iritty and Thaliparambu
