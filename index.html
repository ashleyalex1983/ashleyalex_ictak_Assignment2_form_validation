        <h2>Tourism in Kerala</h2>
        <p>
            Kerala, a state situated on the tropical Malabar Coast of southwestern India, is one of the most popular 
            tourist destinations in the country. Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National Geographic 
            Traveler, Kerala is famous especially for its ecotourism initiatives and beautiful backwaters. Its 
            unique culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demography, have made Kerala one of the most 
            popular tourist destinations in the world. Growing at a rate of 13.31%, the tourism industry is a 
            major contributor to the state's economy. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Until the early 1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown destination, with most tourism circuits concentrated 
            around the north of the country. Aggressive marketing campaigns launched by the Kerala Tourism Development 
            Corporation—the government agency that oversees tourism prospects of the state—laid the foundation for 
            the growth of the tourism industry. In the decades that followed, Kerala Tourism was able to transform 
            itself into one of the niche holiday destinations in India. The tag line Kerala – God's Own Country was 
            adopted in its tourism promotions and became a global superbrand. Kerala is regarded as one of the 
            destinations with the highest brand recall. In 2010, Kerala attracted 660,000 foreign tourist arrivals.

        <h2>Popular Destinations in Kerala</h2>
       <p>
           Kerala is a popular destination for both domestic as well as foreign tourists. Kerala is well known for 
           its beaches, backwaters in Alappuzha and Kollam, mountain ranges and wildlife sanctuaries. Other popular 
           attractions in the state include the beaches at Kovalam, Varkala, Kollam and Kappad; backwater tourism 
           and lake resorts around Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam; hill stations and resorts at Munnar, Wayanad, Nelliampathi, 
           Vagamon and Ponmudi; and national parks and wildlife sanctuaries at Periyar, Parambikulam and Eravikulam 
           National Park. The "backwaters" region—an extensive network of interlocking rivers, lakes, and canals 
           that centre on Ashtamudi Lake, Kollam, also see heavy tourist traffic. Heritage sites, such as the 
           Padmanabhapuram Palace, Hill Palace, and Mattancherry Palace, are also visited.

        <h2>Kerala - God's Own Country</h2>
         <p>
            Sun blanched white seashore. Endless beaches. Incessant blue waves mostly calm but sometimes boisterous 
            clamouring and vanishing among white splashes. Green groves of coconuts just stop short and border the 
            beaches with frills. Lurking in the backdrop a network of lagoons and backwaters. Boats and country 
            crafts moving along. Quite a lot of rivers and countless rivulets flowing through hills and paddy 
            fields of the midland, emptying into the backwaters. And the far off dark blue mountains. This is 
            what the eyes meet about Kerala. An excellent colour scheme and art work of Nature. An occasional 
            boatsman rowing and singing with cargo or people. A tiller or a mower and women planting seedlings. 
            Women at work spinning coir. Dense plantations further eastward.
