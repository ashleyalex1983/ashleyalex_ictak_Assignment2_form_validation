    <section class="content">
        <h2>KASARGODE</h2>
        <p>
            The last formed district of Kerala is Kasargode. Kasargode is the northernmost district of Kerala 
            State of India. It was named after the Kasaragod town located in district. The district is known 
            for its coir and hand loom industries. The district has a coastline of around 293 kilometers and 
            that why the livelihood of Kasargod people mainly depends on fisheries.The Ghats dominate the topography. 
            The district is popular with the forts, rivers, hillocks, beaches and shrines. The district is marked off 
            from the adjoining areas outside the State by the Western Ghats which run parallel to the sea and constitute 
            an almost continuous mountain wall on the eastern side. Various languages are spoken in the district 
            Tulu, Kannada, Malayalam, Konkani, Tamil and other local languages are the popular.
        </p>
        <p>
            The important crops in the hilly areas include rubber, cashew and ginger. This is situated on the sea coast 
            with the Western Ghats its east and northern borders. Central Plantations Crops Research Institute is 
            situated in Kasargode district.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lying at the northern tip of Kerala bounded by the Western Ghats in the east and Arabian sea in the 
            west; twelve rivers flowing across its terrain, Kasaragod is an enchanting beauty of Nature's creations. 
            There are different views on the derivation of the name "KASARAGOD". One view is that it is the 
            combination of two Sanskrit words Kaasaara (which means lake or pond) and Kroda (which means a place 
            where treasure is kept). Another view is that it is the place where Kaasaraka trees (Strychnos nux 
            vomica or Kaanjiram or Kaaraskara) are in abundance. Both views are relevant as there are large number 
            of rivers, lakes and ponds in the coastal belt of the district besides thick flora consisting of 
            innumerable varieties of trees, shrubs etc. particularly plenty of Kaasaraka trees. Many Arab travellers, 
            who came to Kerala between 9th and 14th centuries A.D., visited Kasaragod as it was then an important trade 
            centre. They called this area Harkwillia. Mr. Barbose, the Portuguese traveller,who visited Kumbla near 
            Kasaragod in 1514, had recorded that rice was exported to Male Island whence coir was imported. 
            Dr.Francis Buchanan, who was the family doctor of Lord Wellesly, visited Kasaragod in 1800. 
            In his travelogue, he has included information on the political and communal set-up in places 
            like Athiparamba, Kavvai, Nileshwar, Bekkal, Chandragiri and Manjeshwar.
